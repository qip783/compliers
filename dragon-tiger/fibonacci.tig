â      [ fibonacci.tig ] Complete the following program and save it in a fibonacci.tig file. The function fibonacci should return the \(n^{th}\) term of the Fibonacci
sequence which is defined recursively as follows,
\[f_0 = 1, f_1 = 1 \\ f_{n+2} = f_{n} + f_{n+1}\]
let
function fibonacci(n : int) : int =
/* ... complete here ... */
in
for i := 1 to 8 do
(print_int(fibonacci(i)); print("\n"))
end
